My application can calculate more accurately when accurately inputting movie names and character names. Because I used the method of extracting keywords to find movies and characters, if the user only inputs part of the letters in the name, the first item in the working list which contain these letters will be taken out. It may extract other movies or characters from the list.
I created the original character list and working character list based on movie metadata. In this way, I can find the corresponding movie id by the movie name. I created an original list and a working list based on movie lines data. This way I can find movie lines and character names by movie id. It should be noted that the character names in the dataset are all uppercase, and I converted all the input of the text field of the character name to uppercase letters.
I created a list of movie lines and used the fuction of RiTa.pos to return movie lines with personal pronouns. Dividing the number of returns recorded by the if function by the size of line arraylist is the final result.
